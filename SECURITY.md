## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in Deliverybot, please report it by sending an
email to [security@deliverybot.dev](mailto:security@deliverybot.dev).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
public bug report or CVE. We will notify users via email of any critical
security vulnerabilities that may affect them.
